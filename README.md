# Text Encryptor

## Description

The **Text Encryptor** is a simple web-based tool that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages using specific rules. The application changes certain characters into encoded patterns, effectively hiding the original message. It's ideal for basic text security.

## Features

- **Encrypt Messages:** Changes vowels into encoded combinations (e.g., `e -> enter`, `i -> imes`, `a -> ai`, `o -> ober`, `u -> ufat`).
- **Decrypt Messages:** Converts encoded text back to its original form.
- **Character Counter:** Tracks the number of characters entered in real-time.
- **Warnings:** Alerts users if they enter numbers, uppercase letters, or special characters, which are not allowed.
- **Copy to Clipboard:** Lets users copy the encrypted or decrypted text.
- **Simple Interface:** Easy to use for anyone.

## Usage

1. Access the application on its website.
2. Enter your text message in the provided area.
3. Press **"Encrypt"** to secure your message.
4. To decrypt, paste the encrypted message and press **"Decrypt."**
5. Copy the result using the **"Copy"** button.
6. **Note:** Do not use numbers, special characters, or uppercase letters in the text.
